This project is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
> For personal purposes only.

A few things I have used to build it and why:
- React 16.12.0
  - create-react-app allowed me to start really quickly without having to deal with all the boilerplate and ecosystem around React manually
- CSS3
  - I decided not to include Bootstrap or other "CSS framework" for this project, why? 
    - to keep the visuals clean and unique to this project
    - to challenge my CSS skills and practice using CSS Grid and Flex for layout
    - I wanted to define all my CSS classes and use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) notation adjusted to React components' naming whenever possible
- Sass preprocessor using SCSS syntax
  - great way to style an application from scratch, if you're not familiar with CSS-in-JS libraries (i.e. styled-components) yet
  - I prefer SCSS syntax over Sass syntax all day long due to its readability
- Netlify
  - Deploying a basic FE application from github can't get any easier than this
